# EARTHQUAKE-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-LSTM-RNN
Seismic tremors/Earthquakes are one of the foremost hazardous natural calamity, basically due to the fact that they often occur without an explicit warning, leaving no time to react. This reality makes the issue of prediction of seismic tremor/earthquake greatly imperative for the security of humankind. I propose prediction of earthquake magnitude using a database of seismic events spanning over more than 20 years, by using a recurrent neural network model.The use of RNN layers -SimpleRNN and LSTM layers to improve the accuracy of the previous densely connected NN to an accuracy now of 94.67% (using Dropout layers to avoid overfitting of the NN)
